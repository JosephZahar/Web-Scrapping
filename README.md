# Web-Scrapping
<p align="justify">
You may have found logging on to a website and downloading files to be repetitive and time-consuming. This repository offers a Python program that automatically downloads course materials from a desired website to your computer.
</p>

<p align="justify">
We should first break the task into smaller problems. How can you log in to the website? Navigate to a specific module? Download a file? Save it in a specific location on your computer? Provide options for the user to select a specific module or files?
What options should the user have in running the program? What should the interface be like?

 The python script made available will direct you through the main steps to achieve and complete this task.
